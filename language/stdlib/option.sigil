⟦ Sigil Standard Library - Option Type

The Option type represents an optional value: every Option is either Some and
contains a value, or None, and does not.

This type is used for safe operations that may not return a value, such as:
- Indexing into lists (head, tail, at)
- String operations (charAt, substring)
- Dictionary lookups
- Parsing operations

Option types are common in functional programming and provide a type-safe
alternative to null/undefined.
