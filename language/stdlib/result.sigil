⟦ Sigil Standard Library - Result Type

The Result type represents the result of a computation that may fail.
Every Result is either:
- Ok(T): The computation succeeded with value of type T
- Err(E): The computation failed with error of type E

This type is used for operations that can fail in expected ways, such as:
- I/O operations (file not found, permission denied)
- Parsing (invalid format, unexpected input)
- Network requests (timeout, connection refused)
- Validation (invalid data, constraint violation)

Result types provide type-safe error handling without exceptions.
