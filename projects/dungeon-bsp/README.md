# Dungeon BSP (Sigil Project)

Planned pure-Sigil BSP dungeon generator.

Status:
- scaffold only (not implemented yet)
- waiting until we finish the deterministic baseline and document language friction points

Next target:
- represent BSP tree as sum type
- recursively split regions
- place one room per leaf
- connect sibling centers
