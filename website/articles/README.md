## About These Articles

These articles document real design decisions made during Sigil's development. They serve as:

- **Design rationale** - Why we made specific choices
- **Educational material** - Teaching machine-first language design
- **Historical record** - Evolution of the language
- **Philosophy guide** - Core principles applied in practice

Each article is written at the time of the design decision, capturing the reasoning and trade-offs in real-time.
